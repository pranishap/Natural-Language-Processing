   Named-Entity Classifier
_____________________________

This code builds a named-entity classifier using LogisticRegression. Data used is labeled data from the CoNLL 2003 Shared Task: http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2003/ner/
First different feature sets for the classifier is implemented.Then evaluation metrics for the classifier on the test set is computed. Finally, enumerated over various settings of the features to determine which features result in the highest accuracy.
